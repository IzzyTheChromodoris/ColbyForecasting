```

## GitHub Documents

This is an R Markdown format used for publishing markdown documents to GitHub. When you click the **Knit** button all R code chunks are run and a markdown file (.md) suitable for publishing to GitHub is generated.

## Including Code

You can include R code in the document as follows:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
SPECIES2="Eubalaena glacialis"
fetch_obis(SPECIES2)
```

```{r}
obs2=read_obis(SPECIES2)
obs2
```
```{r}
obs2 = obs2 |>
  filter(!is.na(eventDate))
summary(obs2)
```

```{r}
obs2= obs2 |>
  filter(!is.na(individualCount))
summary(obs2)
```
